# Taskwarrior Antiglare Theme

This is a simple [taskwarrior](http://www.taskwarrior.org) Theme without any
extras, no beauty, but great usability.

## Features
 * Red Things are important. More red things are more important.
 * Grey Things are nice to know, but not important right now.
 * Priorities have no different colors, reports should sort by priority.

## Usage
Just copy antiglare.theme to a nice place on your filesystem, then put this in
your ~/.taskrc:
```
include ~/.task/antiglare.theme
```

## License
Take a look a the awesome *LICENSE*, i like franconian Beer ;)
